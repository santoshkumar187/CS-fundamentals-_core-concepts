# 🖥️ Types of Operating Systems

Operating Systems can be classified based on how they manage resources, handle users, and execute programs.  
Below are the main types:

---

## 1. Batch Operating System
- Executes jobs in batches without user interaction.  
- Jobs are collected, grouped, and processed sequentially.  
- Example: Early IBM mainframes.  
✅ *Advantage:* High CPU utilization.  
❌ *Limitation:* No real-time interaction with the user.  

---

## 2. Time-Sharing Operating System
- Allows multiple users to share the system simultaneously.  
- CPU time is divided into small time slots (time quantum).  
- Example: UNIX.  
✅ *Advantage:* Interactive, supports multitasking.  
❌ *Limitation:* Requires complex scheduling.  

---

## 3. Distributed Operating System
- Runs on a network of interconnected computers.  
- Appears as a single system to the user.  
- Example: LOCUS, Amoeba.  
✅ *Advantage:* Resource sharing, fault tolerance.  
❌ *Limitation:* Expensive and complex to implement.  

---

## 4. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
- Provides immediate response to inputs or events.  
- Used in critical applications like medical systems, robotics, and defense.  
- Example: VxWorks, QNX, RTLinux.  
✅ *Advantage:* Predictable and reliable.  
❌ *Limitation:* Very limited flexibility, costly.  

---

## 5. Network Operating System (NOS)
- Provides services to computers connected via a network.  
- Supports file sharing, printer access, and communication.  
- Example: Windows Server, Novell NetWare.  
✅ *Advantage:* Centralized management.  
❌ *Limitation:* Dependent on network availability.  

---

## 6. Mobile Operating System
- Designed specifically for smartphones and tablets.  
- Provides touch interface, app stores, and connectivity.  
- Example: Android, iOS.  
✅ *Advantage:* Optimized for mobility and usability.  
❌ *Limitation:* Limited hardware control compared to desktop OS.
