1. What is Java?

👉 Java is an object-oriented, platform-independent programming language that runs on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

⚙️ 2. What are the main features of Java?

✅ Simple and Secure
✅ Platform Independent
✅ Object-Oriented
✅ Robust and Multithreaded
✅ Distributed and Portable

☕ 3. What is JVM, JRE, and JDK?

JVM: Executes Java bytecode.

JRE: JVM + libraries (for running programs).

JDK: JRE + development tools (for developing programs).

🧩 4. What are the 4 main OOP principles?

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

🔐 5. What is Encapsulation?

👉 Wrapping data (variables) and methods together in a class.
🧠 Example: using private variables with public getters/setters.

🧬 6. What is Inheritance?

👉 When one class inherits properties from another using the extends keyword.
🧠 Example:

class Dog extends Animal { }

🔄 7. What is Polymorphism?

👉 One name — multiple forms.
Types:

Compile-time (method overloading)

Runtime (method overriding)

🎭 8. What is Abstraction?

👉 Hiding internal implementation and showing only essential features.
🧠 Example: Abstract class or Interface.

📦 9. Difference between Abstract Class and Interface
Abstract Class	Interface
Has abstract + concrete methods	Only abstract (till Java 7)
Supports single inheritance	Supports multiple inheritance
🔁 10. Difference between Overloading and Overriding
Overloading	Overriding
Compile-time	Runtime
Same name, different parameters	Same name, same parameters
💾 11. What is the difference between == and equals()?

== → compares references (memory location)

.equals() → compares content/values

⚡ 12. What is final, finally, and finalize()?
Keyword	Meaning
final	Used to make variable/method/class unchangeable
finally	Used in try-catch to execute code always
finalize()	Called by Garbage Collector before object destruction
🧰 13. What is Exception Handling in Java?

👉 Mechanism to handle runtime errors using try, catch, throw, throws, finally.

🧠 Example:

try {
  int x = 10 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
  System.out.println("Error: " + e);
}

🧱 14. What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exception?
Type	Example	Checked at
Checked	IOException	Compile time
Unchecked	NullPointerException	Runtime
🧩 15. What is the difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer?
Type	Mutable	Thread-safe
String	No	Yes
StringBuilder	Yes	No
StringBuffer	Yes	Yes
🔄 16. What is a Constructor?

👉 Special method used to initialize objects — same name as class, no return type.

🧠 Example:

class Student {
  Student() { System.out.println("Constructor called"); }
}

⚙️ 17. What is the difference between static and non-static?
Static	Non-static
Belongs to class	Belongs to object
Can be called without object	Needs object to call
💬 18. What is ‘this’ and ‘super’ keyword?

this → refers to current class object.

super → refers to parent class object.

🔄 19. What is Multithreading?

👉 Running multiple threads (tasks) simultaneously for better performance.
🧠 Example:

class MyThread extends Thread {
  public void run() { System.out.println("Thread running"); }
}

🧠 20. What is Garbage Collection in Java?

👉 Automatic process by JVM to remove unused objects and free memory.
Use:

System.gc();
