# ⚙️ Functions of an Operating System

The **Operating System (OS)** acts as a manager of all resources in a computer system.  
Its major functions are as follows:

---

## 1. Process Management
- Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.  
- Ensures fair CPU allocation among multiple processes.  
- Provides mechanisms like **multitasking, context switching, and synchronization**.  

---

## 2. Memory Management
- Allocates and deallocates memory space as needed by programs.  
- Keeps track of which parts of memory are free or in use.  
- Supports techniques like **paging, segmentation, and virtual memory**.  

---

## 3. File System Management
- Manages data storage on disks in the form of files and directories.  
- Provides file-related operations: **create, read, write, delete, modify**.  
- Ensures data protection, access permissions, and efficient retrieval.  

---

## 4. I/O Device Management
- Controls and coordinates input/output devices like keyboard, printer, disk.  
- Uses **device drivers** to interact with hardware.  
- Implements **buffering, caching, and spooling** for efficiency.  

---

## 5. Security & Protection
- Protects system resources from unauthorized access.  
- Provides authentication (passwords, biometrics) and access control.  
- Ensures safe execution of programs without interfering with each other.  

---

## 6. User Interface
- Provides a way for users to interact with the system.  
- Can be:
  - **CLI (Command Line Interface)** – text-based interaction  
  - **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** – windows, icons, menus
