Objects:
     real world entity like (functions, methods)

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

A Car in real life has properties (color, model, speed) and behaviors (drive, stop, honk).

In programming, we represent it as an object.


// exmaple
     class Car {
    String color;  is object
    int speed; also object

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("The car is driving at " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();   // Creating object
        myCar.color = "Red";
        myCar.speed = 100;
        myCar.drive();           // Calling method
    }
}
