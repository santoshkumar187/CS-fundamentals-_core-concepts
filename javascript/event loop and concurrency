The JavaScript event loop is a mechanism that allows concurrency—handling multiple 
tasks asynchronously—even though JavaScript runs in a single-threaded environment in both browsers and Node.js.[1][4][5][6]

### Key Components

- **Call Stack:** Where JavaScript tracks function calls. Only one function executes at a time—functions are pushed and popped here as they run.[2][1]
- **Web APIs:** Browser or Node.js features, like timers, AJAX requests, or event listeners. Asynchronous tasks are delegated here.[6]
- **Callback Queue (Macrotasks):** Holds ordinary queued callbacks from asynchronous events, timers, and I/O operations.
- **Microtask Queue:** Reserved for high-priority tasks like Promise resolutions and mutation observers. Microtasks always execute before macrotasks.[6]
- **Event Loop:** Continuously checks if the call stack is empty and, if so, moves tasks from the queues for execution.[4][5]

### Step-by-Step Example

```js
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('setTimeout');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise');
}).then(() => {
  console.log('Another Promise');
});

console.log('End');
```

#### Execution Order

1. `"Start"` is logged first; synchronous code always goes straight to the call stack.
2. `setTimeout` schedules a callback (macrotask) and moves it to the callback queue after 0 ms.
3. The Promise resolves immediately: its `.then` callback enters the microtask queue.
4. `"End"` is logged next as sync code.
5. Once the stack is empty:
   - Microtasks (Promise callbacks) run before macrotasks: `"Promise"`, then `"Another Promise"` are logged.
   - The event loop then runs the earliest macrotask callback: `"setTimeout"` is logged.

**Output:**
```
Start
End
Promise
Another Promise
setTimeout
```


### Microtasks vs. Macrotasks

- **Microtasks** (Promises): Always run immediately after the synchronous code and before any queued macrotask.
- **Macrotasks** (setTimeout, setInterval, I/O): Run after all microtasks have been executed in that loop iteration.[4][6]

concurrency*******************************************




Concurrency in JavaScript means the ability to handle multiple tasks or operations at seemingly the same time, 
even though JavaScript actually executes one task at a time due to its single-threaded model. 
This is made possible by the event loop, asynchronous programming, and the smart use of Web APIs.[1][3][5][8]

### How Concurrency Works

- **Single-threaded Execution:** JavaScript processes code sequentially, one task after another, on a single thread.[7][1]
- **Asynchronous Operations:** When a long-running task like an API call, timer, or file read 
is encountered, JavaScript delegates it to an external environment (Web APIs in browsers, or Node APIs on the server).[5][1]
- **Event Loop:** The event loop constantly checks if the call stack (where code runs) is empty. 
When it is, it moves the next task (usually a callback) from the task queue back to the stack for execution.[3][1]
- **Task Queues:** There are separate queues for macrotasks (timers, I/O) and microtasks (Promise resolutions).
Microtasks always run to completion after the current stack finishes, before any macrotasks.[6][1][3]

### Example

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Async Task Complete");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```

#### Output:
```
Start
End
Async Task Complete
```

- "Start" logs first—the synchronous code goes to the call stack and executes immediately.[1]
- `setTimeout` is delegated to the browser and its callback is set to run after 2 seconds.
- "End" logs next, as it is synchronous too.[1]
- After 2 seconds, the callback is queued and, once the stack is empty, it runs and prints "Async Task Complete".[1]

### Why It Matters

This event loop and concurrency model allow JavaScript to efficiently handle user input, fetch data, and 
perform background tasks without blocking everything else—keeping web pages and apps reactive and smooth. 
Node.js uses the same system to handle thousands of simultaneous connections with a single thread, making it 
great for APIs and real-time services.[8][5][1]
