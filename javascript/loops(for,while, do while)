🔁 1. for Loop
Use case: Repeat a block of code a fixed number of times.

✅ Example: Print numbers 1 to 5
javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Number:", i);
}
How it works:

let i = 1 → start at 1

i <= 5 → run while i is less than or equal to 5

i++ → increment i by 1 after each loop

🔄 2. while Loop
Use case: Repeat as long as a condition is true.

✅ Example: Print numbers until user input is 0
javascript
let num = 5;
while (num !== 0) {
  console.log("Current:", num);
  num--; // simulate user reducing input
}
Key point: If the condition is false at the start, it won’t run at all.

🔂 3. do...while Loop
Use case: Run the loop at least once, even if the condition is false.

✅ Example: Ask for password until correct
javascript
let password;
do {
  password = prompt("Enter password:");
} while (password !== "sangapp123");
console.log("Access granted!");

Here are **5 important JavaScript loop interview questions** with clear answers and examples to help you prepare confidently:

---

### ✅ **1. What are the different types of loops in JavaScript?**

**Answer:**
JavaScript supports several loop types:
- `for` loop
- `while` loop
- `do...while` loop
- `for...in` loop (for object properties)
- `for...of` loop (for iterable values like arrays and strings)

---

### ✅ **2. What’s the difference between `for...in` and `for...of` loops?**

**Answer:**
- `for...in` iterates over **keys** (property names) in an object.
- `for...of` iterates over **values** in iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps.

**Example:**
```javascript
const user = { name: "Santosh", age: 22 };
for (let key in user) {
  console.log(key); // name, age
}

const fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
for (let fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit); // apple, banana
}
```

---

### ✅ **3. How do you break out of a loop early?**

**Answer:**
Use the `break` statement to exit a loop immediately when a condition is met.

**Example:**
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) break;
  console.log(i); // prints 1, 2
}
```

---

### ✅ **4. Write a loop to print even numbers between 1 and 10.**

**Answer:**
```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(i); // prints 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
  }
}
```

---

### ✅ **5. Write a loop that finds the first duplicate element in an array.**

**Answer:**
```javascript
const nums = [1, 3, 5, 3, 7, 1];
const seen = new Set();

for (let num of nums) {
  if (seen.has(num)) {
    console.log("First duplicate:", num); // 3
    break;
  }
  seen.add(num);
}
```
