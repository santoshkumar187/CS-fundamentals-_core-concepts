The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)** is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different computer systems communicate over a network. It divides the communication process into **seven distinct layers**, each with a specific function.

### ðŸ§± OSI Model: 7 Layers Explained

| Layer | Name              | Description                                                                 |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 7     | **Application**   | Interfaces directly with user applications (e.g., browsers, email clients) |
| 6     | **Presentation**  | Translates data formats, handles encryption/decryption and compression     |
| 5     | **Session**       | Manages sessions between applications (start, maintain, end)               |
| 4     | **Transport**     | Ensures reliable data transfer using protocols like TCP/UDP                |
| 3     | **Network**       | Handles routing and IP addressing across networks                          |
| 2     | **Data Link**     | Manages node-to-node data transfer, MAC addressing, error detection        |
| 1     | **Physical**      | Transmits raw bits over physical medium (cables, signals, voltages)        |

### ðŸ”„ How It Works
When data is sent:
- It starts at the **Application layer** and moves down to the **Physical layer**.
- At the receiver's end, it travels back up from **Physical** to **Application**.

Each layer only communicates with its adjacent layers and performs a specific role in the transmission process.
