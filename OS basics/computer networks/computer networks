### üß± The 7 Layers of the OSI Model (Bottom to Top)

| Layer | Name                | Description |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| **7** | **Application**     | Closest to the user. Interfaces with software applications (e.g., browsers, email clients). Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP |
| **6** | **Presentation**    | Translates data formats, encryption/decryption, compression. Think of it as the ‚Äútranslator‚Äù layer |
| **5** | **Session**         | Manages sessions and controls dialogues between computers. Handles session setup, maintenance, and termination |
| **4** | **Transport**       | Ensures reliable data transfer. Handles segmentation, flow control, and error correction. Protocols: TCP, UDP |
| **3** | **Network**         | Determines the best path for data. Handles logical addressing (IP addresses). Protocols: IP, ICMP |
| **2** | **Data Link**       | Responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error detection. Uses MAC addresses. Protocols: Ethernet, PPP |
| **1** | **Physical**        | Deals with the physical connection (cables, switches, voltage levels). Transmits raw bits over the medium |



  1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the OSI Model and why is it important?
Answer: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or
computing system into seven distinct layers. It helps different systems communicate over a network and guides protocol development and troubleshooting.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Name the 7 layers of the OSI Model.
Answer: From top to bottom:

Application

Presentation

Session

Transport

Network

Data Link

Physical

3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between TCP and UDP, and which OSI layer do they belong to?
Answer: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is connection-oriented and ensures reliable data delivery, 
  while UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless and faster but less reliable. Both operate at the Transport Layer (Layer 4).

4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the role of the Data Link Layer?
Answer: The Data Link Layer (Layer 2) is responsible for node-to-node data transfer, error detection and correction, and framing. 
It uses MAC addresses to identify devices on the same network.

5Ô∏è‚É£ How does the Network Layer differ from the Data Link Layer?
Answer: The Network Layer (Layer 3) handles routing and logical addressing (IP addresses), enabling data to travel across multiple networks. 
The Data Link Layer deals with physical addressing and ensures reliable transmission within the same network segment.
