# 🖥️ Introduction to Operating Systems

## What is an Operating System?
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that acts as an **interface between the user and the computer hardware**.  
It manages hardware resources and provides an environment where application programs can run efficiently.

## Why Do We Need an OS?
- To manage hardware resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices.  
- To provide a user-friendly interface for interaction with the system.  
- To ensure fairness, efficiency, and security in system usage.

## Key Roles of an OS
1. **Resource Manager** → Allocates CPU, memory, and I/O devices to programs.  
2. **Program Executor** → Runs applications and handles multitasking.
